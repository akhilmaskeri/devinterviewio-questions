11. What is a class?
12. What is the relationship between a class and an object?
13. Explain the basic features of OOPs
14. A structure in C# can implement one or more interfaces. Is it true or false?
15. What is polymorphism, what is it for, and how is it used?
16. How can you prevent a class from overriding in C#?
17. When should I use a struct instead of a class?
18. What are abstract classes? What are the distinct characteristics of an abstract class?
19. How can you prevent your class to be inherited further?
20. What are the different ways a method can be overloaded?
21. Is it possible for a class to inherit the constructor of its base class?
22. How is method overriding different from method overloading?
23. State the features of an interface.
24. How could you defineAbstraction in OOP?
25. Can you specify the accessibility modifier for methods inside the interface?
26. Can you allow a class to be inherited, but prevent a method from being overridden in C#?
27. What do you mean by data encapsulation?
28. What are similarities between a class and a structure?
29. Interface or an Abstract Class: which one to use?
30. Explain the concept of destructor?
31. What is Coupling in OOP?
32. What exactly is the difference between an interface and abstract class?
33. Explain different types of inheritance.
34. Differentiate between an abstract class and an interface.
35. When should I use an interface and when should I use a base class?
36. What is the difference between an abstract function and a virtual function?
37. What is the difference between cohesion and coupling?
38. Does .NET support multiple inheritance?
39. Can you declare an overridden method to be static if the original method is not static?
40. What is a static constructor?
41. What is Cohesion in OOP?
42. What's the advantage of using getters and setters - that only get and set - instead of simply using public fields for those variables?
43. Can you declare a private class in a namespace?
44. In terms that an OOP programmer would understand (without any functional programming background), what is a monad?
45. What is the difference between association, aggregation and composition?
46. Can you provide a simple explanation of methods vs. functions in OOP context?
47. You have defined a destructor in a class that you have developed by using the C# programming language, but the destructor never executed. Why did the destructor not execute?
48. What is LSP (Liskov Substitution Principle) and what are some examples of its use (good and bad)?
49. Could you elaborate Polymorphism vs Overriding vs Overloading?
50. What does it mean to “program to an interface”?
51. Why Doesn't C# Allow Static Methods to Implement an Interface?
52. What is the difference between a mixin and inheritance?
53. Why prefer composition over inheritance? What trade-offs are there for each approach? When should you choose inheritance over composition?
54. How do I test a private function or a class that has private methods, fields or inner classes?
